# Get started with InfernoJS (like ReactJS, but extreme performance)
 with this minimal app

### There are just a few steps to get you up and running

- You will need to have `nodejs` and `npm` already installed. Follow instructions at https://nodejs.org/
- Clone the project:
  `git clone https://github.com/rohanthewiz/inferno_barebones.git`
- Change to the *project root*: `cd inferno_barebones`
- Install project dependencies:  `npm install`
- Install browserify  `npm install -g browserify`
- You can watch for changed files or manually build.
    - To automatically build when files change:
        - Open another terminal and change directory to the project root
        - Run `npm run watch`
    - To manually build: `npm run build`
- Start the server: `npm start`
- View the output in your browser by navigating to `localhost:8081` (CTRL-C to exit the server)

You are set! Find a good tutorial and start writing blazing fast Inferno apps! You can start here: [github.com/trueadm/inferno](https://github.com/trueadm/inferno).
`src/App.jsx` is a good place to start tinkering - go for it!
You probably want to check out Mobx too https://github.com/nightwolfz/mobx-inferno if you need more adrenaline rush.


Thanks to [Geoforce](http://geoforce.com/ "World class asset tracking") for getting me started on the React ecosystem.
